        "Trading Pattern in Laning Phase":"Wait for him to use Q1 into E for poke then wait out his Q ramp up for a bit. His cds are extremly high early game without 40% cdr so if he uses it for poke/wave clear he wont have abilities to counter your all in. Always use your ult to dodge his 3rd Q in his R because he will never get to cast it twice.",
        "Wave Management":"He will auto-shove with his Q's anyway so try to keep the wave even and in the middle, never all in unless he used an ability, he heavy outdmgs your rotation",
        "Runes":"Conq-triumph-bloodline-last stand  and bash + bone plating",
        "Items":"Rush exe calling into normal camille build tri force - ravenous",
        "Teamfight vs Splitpush":"U can do both depending if ahead or behind, if ahead do whatever is best for your team u beat him on side really easily so just shove and rotate"

    {
        "Akali":"",
        "Trading Pattern in Laning Phase":"start W and max E, poke her with W whenever its up it will sustain you thourgh  the lane, stick close to walls most akalis wont have the brain to react to your fast hookshot with E which will give u a lot of free kills, no need to rush mr besides mercs just dont eat too many Q's and you should be fine, when her 2nd R is ready spam your ultimatum on your face so you will dodge it 9/10 times.",
        "Wave Management":"Manage waves in a way that they are either close to her tower or your tower, if wave is in the middle u cant touch her at all, freezes are super broken here",
        "Runes":"Conq + second wind",
        "Items":"Tri force rush",
        "Teamfight vs Splitpush":"Only split after 2 items or split safely to farm. in 5v5's u do the same thing what akali does"
